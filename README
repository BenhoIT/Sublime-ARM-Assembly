This is a fork of aumuell's ARM Assembly bundle, it seems to fix some of the issues with the original, including the adding of symbol detection for labels.

Also, this was forked from drd's fork of foxostro's x86 Assembly bundle, which,
in turn was forked from amorrow's PIC Assembly syntax.

This bundle is in the public domain.
