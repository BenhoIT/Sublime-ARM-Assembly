This is a TextMate bundle which provides very basic language syntax for some
ARM assembly.  It hasn't been tested extensively, but it seems to work well
enough on the assembly files I worked on for another project.

Also, this was forked from drd's fork of foxostro's x86 Assembly bundle, which,
in turn was forked from amorrow's PIC Assembly syntax.

As drd's x86 Assembly bundle is a public repository on GitHub, I assume that
I have his permission to fork the project and make redistribute my changes. The
changes that I've made are placed in the Public Domain.
