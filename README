This is a fork of aumuell's ARM Assembly bundle, it seems to fix some of the issues with the original, including the adding of symbol detection for labels.

Also, this was forked from drd's fork of foxostro's x86 Assembly bundle, which,
in turn was forked from amorrow's PIC Assembly syntax.

As drd's x86 Assembly bundle is a public repository on GitHub, I assume that
I have his permission to fork the project and make redistribute my changes. The
changes that I've made are placed in the Public Domain.
